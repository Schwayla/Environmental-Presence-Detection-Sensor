# Introduction
  - This is a sensor that uses the DFRobot mmWave Sensor, Panasonic PIR Sensor, and BMP280 for motion detection and environmental data for use on ESPHome. As you may have guessed this was a project inspired by Everything Smart Home's video and subsequent sensor as well as his inspiration igiannakas who made a similar sensor.
  - I am new to coding so this is probably not the best way to code this but it works.
  
# Bill of Materials
  - D1 Mini 8266, Type-C (Aliexpress)
  - USB-C to USB-C Cable (Aliexpress)
  - USB-C Charger (I use an ANKER PowerPort III buts that's overkill)

  - BMP280 (Aliexpress / Amazon)
  - Solid-Core 22AWG wire (Aliexpress)
  - 10K Ohm Resistor (Aliexpress / Amazon)
  - ElecrtoCookie Prototyping PCB Board (Amazon)
  
# Tools Needed
  - Soldering Iron (I like the TS100)
  - Hot Glue Gun (I use a Gorilla Glue Hi/Low)
  - Wire strippers
  - Flush-Cut Wire Cutters (Aliexpress or Knipex)
  - Permanent Marker (I use silver)
  - (OPT) Soldering mat or holder
  - (OPT) Breadboard (To test everything first)
  
# Not Included in this tutorial...
  - The Skills to do the things in this tutorial. YouTube is my best friend when it comes to learning how to do something and it can do a much better job of teaching you the skills needed to make this than I can.
  - I had to look up how to make a README on here so...
